This repository contains a framework that comprises all the basic stages to learn an audio representation via unsupervised contrastive learning, and then evaluate the representation via supervised sound event classifcation. Please check our paper for more details. The system is implemented in PyTorch.

We're currently cleaning the code, which will be made available in the next few weeks. We will announce when it is available via <a href="https://twitter.com/edfonseca_" target="_blank">twitter</a>.

In the meantime, make sure to take a look at our paper!
